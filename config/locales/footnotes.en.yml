      <p class="govuk-body">
        A claim for a customs duty waiver for duty on goods that would otherwise incur “at risk” tariffs is provided as “de minimis aid”. The maximum allowance for most sectors is €200,000 across a rolling three tax year period. This allowance includes all de minimis aid you have claimed over a 3 tax year period.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        This type of aid is measured in euros, so it is important to convert any aid received in pound sterling into euros. You can use this <a target="_blank" href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/procedures-guidelines-tenders/information-contractors-and-beneficiaries/exchange-rate-inforeuro_en" class="govuk-link">exchange rate tool</a> to calculate the applicable euro equivalent of the value of the aid for the month you were awarded the aid.
